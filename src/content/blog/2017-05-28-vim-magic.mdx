I've been using the [Vim editor](http://www.vim.org) for a while, and I really like it. However, it's true that the learning curve is steep. With so many options, even after years of use, you can still discover new tricks.

This is a compilation of my favorite commands, which I'll continue updating as I discover more (think of this as my personal quick reference).

- `zt` – Scroll the current line to the top of the window.
- `zb` – Scroll the current line to the bottom of the window.

## Exporting Your Configuration

You can save and synchronize your Vim configuration across machines by turning your `~/.vim` directory into a Git repository. Push it to a platform like GitHub.  
You can find [my repository here](https://github.com/mrdonado/.vim), with instructions in the README for setup.

## ...and Of Course

- `:q!` – [Don't get stuck in Vim](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/). Exit without saving. :)
