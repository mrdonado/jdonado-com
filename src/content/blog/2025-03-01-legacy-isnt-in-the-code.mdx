In one of his talks, [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) asked the audience why nobody uses [`goto`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto) anymore. The reason, he explained, isn’t that everyone suddenly agreed `goto` is bad. It’s not because we all internalized the dangers of [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code). No—the reason is much simpler.  
**The programmers who used `goto` are either retired or dead.**

Change doesn’t always happen because everyone sees the light. It often happens because old ways fade away along with the people who championed them.

## **Digital Transformation Without Change?**

If you've been around long enough, you've probably seen a "digital transformation" project that was nothing more than a bad analog process **copy-pasted into the digital world**. No improvements. No simplifications. Just the same inefficiencies, now digitized.

It’s no surprise that [so many millions are wasted on digital transformation](https://hbr.org/2019/03/digital-transformation-is-not-about-technology).

Yet, if you scroll through LinkedIn, it seems like **everyone** is "challenging the status quo" and "driving change." The reality? Things in large organizations tend to stay the same. It reminds me of that study showing that [80% of men think they’re above-average drivers](https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-are-overconfident-in-their-driving-skills-2018-1).

If so many people claim to be agents of change, why does everything still feel stuck?

## Why is Change So Hard?

The problem isn't usually technical—it’s **cultural and cognitive**.

We think of **legacy systems** as outdated software filled with ugly, tangled code. But the **real** legacy problem is **in our brains**—in the habits, assumptions, and unspoken rules that govern how things get done.

### 1. [The Sunk Cost Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)

So much time, effort, and money have been invested in a process, system, or product that abandoning it feels like admitting failure. Instead of cutting losses, we double down, hoping to eventually justify past decisions.

### 2. [Cognitive Inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_inertia)

When something has been done a certain way for long enough, changing it feels unnatural—sometimes we don’t even realize there’s another way. If an entire team or company follows this pattern, **[communal reinforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_reinforcement)** kicks in: "This is just how we do things here."

**The result?** Bad processes persist **not because they work, but because they exist**.

## What Can We Do?

If you're in an organization stuck in outdated ways—and **you care enough** to change it (that part is crucial)—here are a few strategies that might help.

### 1. Name It. Measure It. Make It Visible.

We can’t fix what we don’t acknowledge.

- **Give inefficiencies a name.** If something doesn’t have a name, it’s almost as if it doesn’t exist. A label makes it easier to discuss and tackle.
- **Measure it.** Data is your best friend. If you can quantify an inefficiency, you can prove its impact and make it harder to ignore. _What gets measured, gets managed_.
- **Expose the pain points.** Sometimes, just making inefficiencies **visible** is enough to get the ball rolling. Like reverse magic: make the invisible visible.

### 2. You’re Probably Not Alone

Find others who **also** see the problem. **Change rarely comes from one person—it comes from a group of individuals who follow a certain path and create momentum.**

- Identify **"champions of change"**—colleagues who also recognize the problem and are willing to push for a solution.
- Take a **[systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking)** approach. Look for interventions that create **non-linear effects** (small changes that lead to big improvements).
- Start **small**. A pilot project that demonstrates success can be more persuasive than a PowerPoint full of theories.

### 3. Be Relentless (or Call It "Vision")

**Persistence wins.** Even if it doesn’t sound glamorous, one of the most effective ways to drive change is **[the broken record technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertiveness#Techniques)**: bringing up the issue **over and over again** until people finally acknowledge it.

Of course, instead of calling it "nagging," you might prefer to call it **"vision."**

## Challenge the Goto in Your Organization

Change isn’t just about updating technology or processes—it’s about **challenging what we take for granted**.

So next time you hear, _"But this is how we've always done it,"_ take it as a cue.

Ask instead: **"Is this still the best way?"**

Because if we don’t challenge it, we’ll just keep using `goto`—until, eventually, a new generation ([or an AI](/post/2025-02-05-will-ai-replace-us-all/)...) comes along and replaces us.
