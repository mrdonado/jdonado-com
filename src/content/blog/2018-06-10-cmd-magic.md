# Command Line Magic

Last year I published [Vim Magic]({% link _posts/2017-05-28-vim-magic.markdown %}), where I gathered all the commands that I found particularly useful when using the Vim editor. I've kept updating it ever since whenever I've found new useful tricks. It's been so far helpful to me as a reference and hopefully to somebody else out there too. This post is the same but for the command line in Linux/Unix.

This is not intended to be a tutorial with the basics for you to learn how to use the command line. Instead, it's more like a reference for somebody who's been using the terminal for some time now and wants to learn some new tricks or remember older ones.

{% highlight bash %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Scripts

- `#!/bin/bash` use this as the first line of a bash script, for the interpreter to know how to handle it

## Files

- `for i in *.png ; do convert "$i" "${i%.*}.jpg" ; done` convert all **png** files into **jpg**
- `find . -type f -exec grep -El "someWord|someOtherWord" {} \;` find all files in the current directory (and above) that contain `someWord` or `someOtherWord`. An escaped semicolon is necessary to indicate the end of `exec`. The brackets are also necessary, since they contain the output of the `find` command, that will be fed into the grep command
- `find . -type f | xargs grep -El "something|appstore"` exactly the same as the previous command, using `xargs` instead of `-exec`
- `find /path/to/files* -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \;` delete files older than 5 days
- `find . -name  '*.zip' -exec unzip {} \;` unzip all the zip files in the current directory
- `find . -type d | egrep -o '.*src$'` find `src` directories and none of their subdirectories
- `find . 2>/dev/null` find without showing `permission denied` messages
- `wdiff one.txt two.txt | colordiff` color the differences between **one.txt** and **two.txt**
- `diff -rq(w) dir1 dir2` compare two directory structures
- `SOME_FILE=$(<some-file.txt)` load the contents of **some-file.txt** into the variable **SOME_FILE**
- `cat oldfile.txt | tr -d '\n' > newfile.txt` create newfile.txt as a copy of oldfile where all newlines have been removed
- `convert file.{jpg,png}` equivalent to `convert file.jpg file.png`

With `xargs` you can avoid loops (it passes the stdout as input to the specified command):

- `find . -name *.png | xargs rm -rf` remove recursively all png files
- `git branch --merged | grep -v \* | xargs git branch -D` remove all local git branches that have already been merged

## Users and Groups

- `cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1` list all users
- `cat /etc/group | cut -d: -f1` list all groups
- `chown user file` change the owner of a file
- `chgrp group file` change the group of a file
- `chown user:group file` change the owner and group of a file

## Networking and SSH

- `lsof -nP | grep 9092` show which process is blocking the port 9092
- `rsync -avz --remove-source-files -e ssh /local/dir remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/dir` SSH copy files and remove source
- `ssh user@your-server.com -L 2000:25` SSH session and port tunneling
- `ssh -Y user@your-server.com` start an xterm
- `sudo route delete default gw 10.0.2.2 eth0` remove the default gateway on `eth0`
- `sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.254 eth0` add the default gateway on `eth0`
- `wget -c -t 0 --timeout=60 --waitretry=60 --read-timeout=10 http://example.com/file.mkv` download the file using the partially downloaded file (resume `-c`) retrying ad infinitum (`-t 0`), with 60s timeout and 60s wait between attempts, resetting the connection if there's no activity in 10 seconds (`--read-timeout=10`)
- `wget -r -np -nH -R index.html http://hostname/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/` download all files and subfolders of the `ddd` directory, recursively (`-r`), without going to upper directories (`-np`), not saving to the hostname folder (`-nH`), exclude `index.html` files (`-r index.html`)

## Random Magic

- `<ctrl>+r` reverse search: in order to search for a command you previously used
- `cal` print the current month
- `sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall` in debian-based distros, install the essentials for building packages (make; make install)
- `openssl base64 -in input.txt -out encoded.b64` encode **input.txt** in base64 and save it to the file **encoded.b64**
- `sudo !!` run the last command with sudo
- ` `+any command: it won't go to the history
- `$( command )` it gives the output of command
- `service --status-all` status of services
- `echo "hello world" | sed -e "s/e/o/g" | sed -e "s/lo/a/g" | sed -e "s/world/mundo/g"` translate "hello world" to spanish
- `docker ps | awk '{print $8}'` print only the names of the current containers

## Remote SSH session without a password

- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` # Generate an rsa key pair
- `ssh-copy-id youruser@yourserver` # Authorize your key in the remote server
- `ssh youruser@yourserver` # Login without entering a password
