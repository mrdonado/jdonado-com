## Avoiding Dependency Conflicts

If you've been using Node.js and its npm package manager, chances are you'll eventually encounter dependency conflicts. This might happen when cloning an old project, updating your environment, or regenerating the `node_modules` folder.

Sometimes, running `npm install` doesn't provide the exact modules you need, and suddenly things break. This issue often arises when there are [non-specific versions](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver) defined for some dependencies in your `package.json`. For instance, approximate versions using a tilde (`~1.2.3`) or a caret (`^1.2.3`) may cause unexpected issues.

While tildes and carets are useful for automatically pulling newer versions, they can break your project if the updates are incompatible with your code. To prevent this, specify a fixed version (e.g., `1.2.3`) for each dependency in your `package.json`.

### Locking Dependency Versions

Even using specific module versions may not fully prevent conflicts. Locking down all dependencies and their sub-dependencies can be a lifesaver.

#### Using npm-shrinkwrap

Run the [npm-shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap) command to generate an `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file. This file [locks](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-locks) all the npm dependencies to specific versions:

```bash
npm shrinkwrap
```

#### Using Yarn

A more modern alternative is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/yarn-lock), which creates a `yarn.lock` file. This achieves the same goal as `npm-shrinkwrap.json` but is more deterministic and, therefore, safer. Yarn is fully compatible with npm's `package.json`.

1. Install Yarn globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

2. Run Yarn in your project's root directory:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

This generates a `yarn.lock` file. Be sure to commit the `yarn.lock` file to your version control system.

## Removing Unneeded Dependencies

To clean up your `node_modules` directory by removing modules no longer required, use the [prune](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/prune) command:

```bash
npm prune
```

To remove unnecessary _devDependencies_ as well, use:

```bash
npm prune --production
```

This is especially useful before running `npm shrinkwrap` if you’ve manually removed dependencies from your `package.json`.

---

## Listing Outdated Dependencies

To check for outdated dependencies in your project, use the [npm-outdated](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated) command:

```bash
npm outdated
```

---

## Updating Dependencies

The `npm-check-updates` module helps you automatically update your dependencies to their latest versions. Be cautious, as updating multiple dependencies simultaneously can introduce breaking changes.

1. Install `npm-check-updates` globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g npm-check-updates
   ```

2. Update your `package.json` with the `-u` option:

   ```bash
   npm-check-updates -u
   ```

3. Install the updated dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   _Tip: You may need to delete the `node_modules` folder first to ensure a clean installation._

## Additional Useful Commands

- `npm ls` – List all installed packages.
- `npm dedupe` – Reduce duplication in your `node_modules` folder.
