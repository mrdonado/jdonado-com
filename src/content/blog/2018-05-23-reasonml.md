# ReasonML Programming Language

## What is ReasonML? Where does it come from? What can I do with it?

ReasonML is a functional programming language offering a modern syntax for [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), designed to work seamlessly with JavaScript via [BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io/). If you're curious about how ReasonML compares to OCaml, check out the [official documentation](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/comparison-to-ocaml.html).

Originally created at Facebook, ReasonML caught my attention through [Nick Graf](https://twitter.com/nikgraf)'s Egghead course, [Get Started with Reason](https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-reason). This post evolved from my notes while following the course, so big thanks to him for the insightful code examples.

For a deeper dive into ReasonML, Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's excellent book, [Exploring ReasonML and Functional Programming](http://reasonmlhub.com/exploring-reasonml/), is available to read online for free.

## What I Like and Dislike So Far

### What I Like

- **Inferred types** simplify the coding process.
- **Custom types and variants** enhance expressiveness.
- Exhaustive compiler checks ensure you handle all switch cases.
- Command-line code suggestions are incredibly helpful.
- Strong **JavaScript and OCaml interoperability**.
- Lexical scoping keeps things predictable.
- The `if` statement is an **expression** that returns a value.
- The **syntax for switch expressions** is clean and intuitive.
- Objects (or records) are defined similarly to TypeScript.
- JavaScript-inspired destructuring and spread operators.
- Combination of **variants and switch expressions** is powerful.
- Null safety: Variants `None` and `Some` replace null.
- **Partial function application** and automatic currying.
- Labeled parameters allow arguments in any order.
- Support for optional parameters.
- **Pipe operator** for clean function composition.
- Direct equality comparison for nested structures.
- Both **structural (`==`)** and **referential equality (`===`)**.
- Robust **pattern matching** for expressive logic.

### What I Dislike

- Shadowing allows variables to be redefined.
- The `++` operator for string concatenation feels counterintuitive.
- Built-in functions have **underscores** in their names.
- Syntax can feel cluttered with excessive **semicolons**.

## Code Examples

Here are some illustrative examples:

```js

let foo = {
  let a = 40;
  let b = 1;
  a + b + 1;
}; // this will bind 42 to the name `foo`

let isMorning = true;
// This binds "Good Morning" to the name `greeting`
let greeting = if (isMorning) {"Good Morning"} else {"Hello"};

// A switch expression
let greeting = stranger =>
  switch (stranger) {
    | Teacher => "Hey professor"
    | Director => "Hello director"
    | Student("Richard") => "Still here Ricky?"
    | Student(anyOtherName) => "Hey, " ++ anyOtherName ++ "."
    | _ => "unknown"
  };

// A person type definition
type person = {
  name: string,
  age: int,
  mutable mood: string, // mood is the only mutable field in this type
};

// A record of type person
let tim = {
  name: "Tim",
  age: 52,
  mood: "happy"
};

// Destructuring a person type into variables timsAge and timsName
let {age: timsAge, name: timsName} = tim;

// Custom type answer (tagged union or variant)
type answer =
  | Yes
  | No
  | Maybe;

// Further assignments automatically infer the type
let isItRaining = Maybe; // It infers type `answer`

// You can define functions like this (in this case, types are optional, since they
// can be inferred
let add: (x: int, y: int) : int => x + y;

// A function with labelled and optional parameters
let name = (~firstName="Defaultname", ~middleName=?, ~lastName, ()) => {
  switch (middleName) {
  | Some(value) => firstName ++ " " ++ value ++ " " ++ lastName
  | None => firstName ++ " " ++ lastName
  };
};

// Pipe operators example: find the largest element smaller than 4
[8, 3, 6, 1]
  |> List.sort(compare)
  |> List.rev
  |> List.find(x => x < 4);

// Recursive functions (without rec, the function cannot call itself)
let rec countBack = x => {
  if (x > 1) {
    print_int(x);
    countBack(x - 1);
  };
};

// There are tuples too (unlike lists, they can contain elements of different types)
("this is", 1, "tuple", "of four elements")

// And there are arrays. Unlike lists, they're mutable
[|3, 4|]

// A pattern matching example
switch ([|"a", "b", "c"|]) {
| [|"a", "b", _|] => print_endline("a, b and something")
| [|_, x, y|] => print_endline("something and " ++ x ++ " " ++ y)
| _ => print_endline("An Array")
};

// Example Math module
module Math = {
  let pi = 3.1415;
  let add = (x, y) => x + y;
};

// Then access everything using dot notation
Math.pi; // Returns 3.1415

```
