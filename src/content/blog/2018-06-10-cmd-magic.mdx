# Command Line Magic

Last year, I published [Vim Magic](/post/2017-05-28-vim-magic/), a compilation of useful commands for the Vim editor. I’ve been updating it ever since whenever I come across new tips and tricks. It has been a handy reference for me and hopefully for others as well. This post aims to do the same, but for the Linux/Unix command line.

This is not a beginner’s tutorial on how to use the command line. Instead, it’s a reference for those who are already familiar with the terminal and want to learn some new tricks or revisit older ones.

---

## Scripts

- `#!/bin/bash` Use this as the first line of a bash script to specify the interpreter.

---

## Files

- `for i in *.png; do convert "$i" "${i%.*}.jpg"; done` Convert all **.png** files to **.jpg**.
- `find . -type f -exec grep -El "someWord|someOtherWord" {} \;` Find all files in the current directory (and subdirectories) containing `someWord` or `someOtherWord`. Use the escaped semicolon to indicate the end of the `exec` command.
- `find . -type f | xargs grep -El "something|appstore"` Similar to the previous command but uses `xargs` instead of `-exec`.
- `find /path/to/files* -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \;` Delete files older than five days.
- `find . -name '*.zip' -exec unzip {} \;` Unzip all zip files in the current directory.
- `find . -type d | egrep -o '.*src$'` Find directories named `src` but exclude their subdirectories.
- `find . 2>/dev/null` Run `find` while suppressing `permission denied` messages.
- `wdiff one.txt two.txt | colordiff` Highlight differences between **one.txt** and **two.txt** in color.
- `diff -rq(w) dir1 dir2` Compare two directory structures.
- `SOME_FILE=$(<some-file.txt)` Load the contents of **some-file.txt** into the variable **SOME_FILE**.
- `cat oldfile.txt | tr -d '\n' > newfile.txt` Create **newfile.txt** as a copy of **oldfile.txt** but with all newlines removed.
- `convert file.{jpg,png}` Equivalent to `convert file.jpg file.png`.

With `xargs`, you can avoid loops by passing the output of one command as input to another:

- `find . -name "*.png" | xargs rm -rf` Recursively delete all **.png** files.
- `git branch --merged | grep -v \* | xargs git branch -D` Delete all local Git branches that have already been merged.

---

## Users and Groups

- `cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1` List all users.
- `cat /etc/group | cut -d: -f1` List all groups.
- `chown user file` Change the owner of a file.
- `chgrp group file` Change the group of a file.
- `chown user:group file` Change both the owner and group of a file.

---

## Networking and SSH

- `lsof -nP | grep 9092` Find the process using port 9092.
- `rsync -avz --remove-source-files -e ssh /local/dir remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/dir` Transfer files via SSH and delete them from the source after copying.
- `ssh user@your-server.com -L 2000:25` Open an SSH session with port tunneling.
- `ssh -Y user@your-server.com` Start an X11 session.
- `sudo route delete default gw 10.0.2.2 eth0` Remove the default gateway on `eth0`.
- `sudo route add default gw 192.168.1.254 eth0` Add a default gateway on `eth0`.
- `wget -c -t 0 --timeout=60 --waitretry=60 --read-timeout=10 http://example.com/file.mkv` Resume a partially downloaded file (`-c`), retry indefinitely (`-t 0`), with specific timeouts and retries.
- `wget -r -np -nH -R index.html http://hostname/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/` Download all files and subdirectories from the `ddd` directory, without ascending (`-np`), skipping `index.html` files (`-R index.html`), and omitting the hostname directory (`-nH`).

---

## Random Magic

- `<Ctrl>+r` Reverse search: search for a previously used command.
- `cal` Display the current month’s calendar.
- `sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall` Install essential tools for building packages (for Debian-based systems).
- `openssl base64 -in input.txt -out encoded.b64` Encode **input.txt** in Base64 and save it as **encoded.b64**.
- `sudo !!` Re-run the last command with `sudo`.
- ` `+command: Prevent the command from being saved in the history.
- `$( command )` Capture the output of a command.
- `service --status-all` Display the status of all services.
- `echo "hello world" | sed -e "s/e/o/g" | sed -e "s/lo/a/g" | sed -e "s/world/mundo/g"` Translate "hello world" into "hoa mundo" using multiple `sed` substitutions.
- `docker ps | awk '{print $8}'` Display only the names of current Docker containers.

## Remote SSH Sessions Without a Password

1. `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` Generate an RSA key pair.
2. `ssh-copy-id youruser@yourserver` Authorize the key on the remote server.
3. `ssh youruser@yourserver` Log in without entering a password.
