> Think you have what it takes to be an astronaut? Memorize and recall sequences in normal, reversed, or random order. Train your brain and aim for the stars!

Inspired by the rigorous cognitive tests astronauts undergo, this game challenges you to memorize and recall sequences of numbers—both forwards and in reverse.

Game Modes:

- Normal Mode: Memorize and repeat number sequences in the order they appear.
- Reversed Mode: Flip the script and repeat sequences backwards.
- Random Challenge: Stay sharp! Sequences may need to be recalled in regular or reversed order.

Enhance your memory, focus, and cognitive skills.
