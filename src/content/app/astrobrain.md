Inspired by the rigorous cognitive tests astronauts undergo, this game challenges you to memorize and recall sequences of numbers—both forwards and in reverse.

Game Modes:

- Normal Mode: Memorize and repeat number sequences in the order they appear.
- Reversed Mode: Flip the script and repeat sequences backwards.
- Random Challenge: Stay sharp! Sequences may need to be recalled in regular or reversed order.

Enhance your memory, focus, and cognitive skills.
