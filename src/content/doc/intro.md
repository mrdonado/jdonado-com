My name is **Javier Donado**, and I’m a [full-stack web developer and Solution Architect](/about) who has been writing code since the early 2000s. I also create [apps for iOS and Android](/apps) using React Native, and I love [open-source](https://github.com/mrdonado).

Beyond coding, I’m a passionate [travel photographer](https://instagram.com/jdonadolens) and a longtime [guitarist and composer](https://jdonado.bandcamp.com).
