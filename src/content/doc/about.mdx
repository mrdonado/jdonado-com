My name is **Javier Donado**, and I love **Product Engineering**: transforming ideas from concept to reality with a mix of technical expertise, design thinking, and strategic execution.

I’m a [software craftsman](https://github.com/mrdonado) and lifelong creator, building systems, exploring ideas, and bringing projects to life since the early 2000s. Today, I work as a [**Solution Architect**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/f-javier-r-donado), overseeing and guiding multiple technical teams in a dynamic, international enterprise environment.

Beyond coding and architecture, I’m also a [travel photographer](https://instagram.com/jdonadolens), and a longtime [guitarist and composer](https://open.spotify.com/artist/60ICs7yKs1yRwW1ZVIJzYV).
