My name is **Javier Donado**. I’m a full-stack software developer, [writing code](https://github.com/mrdonado) since the early 2000s. Today, I work as a [**Solution Architect**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/f-javier-r-donado), overseeing and guiding multiple technical teams in a dynamic corporate environment.

Beyond coding and architecture, I’m a passionate [travel photographer](https://instagram.com/jdonadolens), and a longtime [guitarist and composer](https://open.spotify.com/artist/60ICs7yKs1yRwW1ZVIJzYV).
