## About Me

Welcome to my website, amigos! My name is F. Javier R. Donado, I was born in Madrid (Spain), and I moved to Stuttgart (Germany) in September 2012.

I’ve been [writing software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M) since the early 2000s. My favorite programming languages are TypeScript, Python, and Kotlin, although I’ve used many more over the years, including Java, JavaScript, C++, Clojure, PHP, and Perl. My focus is web development (full-stack) and mobile apps using React Native.

I hold a master's degree in [Telecommunications Engineering](https://www.uc3m.es/master/telecommunication-engineering) and currently work as a [Solution Architect](https://scaledagileframework.com/solution-architect/) at [Porsche Digital](https://porsche.digital/) in Ludwigsburg.

I’m passionate about flexible and scalable architectures, DDD, functional programming, AWS, Docker, VIM, Visual Studio Code, and the satisfying look and feel of my custom mechanical keyboard (with silent switches!).

In addition to writing software, I’m an [avid photographer](https://instagram.com/jdonadolens), guitar collector, and [music composer in my home studio](https://jdonado.bandcamp.com).

Auf Wiedersehen!
